Alot of taboos in society are not opposed on any rational basis

But when you question these taboos

You get the most visceral of responses but with no actual reason behind the response besides "it's morally wrong"

Which is not rational.

Morality is in fact the reason itself.

In this sense,

The Morality on certain taboos is self justifying

"It's bad because it's bad"

Most of the time this phenomenon doesn't matter, harmless.

However, it can take an actively harmful form.

Such as the discussion on Kink at pride. Where this kind of moralizing became queerphobia.

This kind of Moralizing, I would say is the prevailing ideology of our society.

The ideology/Philosophy of "Self Justification Morality" as I will be referring to it

Given the actively harmful role this Self Justification Morality can take, it would be fair to say this kind of Moralizing, must be combatted.

The Fascist has no greater best friend than this form of morality.

This form of morality can go both ways,

It can also take a form of "it's good because it's good"

The Fascist sees utility in both forms, "The Degenerate is bad because it's a Degenerate"

"tradition is good because it's tradition"

Making this kind of Moralizing, genuinely a Fascistic form of thinking.

Now, let's go back to something I previously said "it's usually harmless", I lied, it's always harmful.

For it creates an environment where it is impossible to criticize taboos! Impossible to criticize systems even! You cannot even criticize concepts as they too have become taboo to criticize. (Example: intelligence and sanity are nearly untouchable due to this moralization)

The only way to negate this moralization, is to, reject any objective forms of morality and embrace fully, the idea, that all morality is wholly subjective.
